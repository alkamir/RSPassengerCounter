# RealSense Passenger Counter (RSPCN)
This is going to be my Electronics Engineering Master's Thesis.

### Goal
Developing a Passenger Counter (PCN) in a transportation environment using OpenCV and its hardware acceleration capabilities on different hardware platforms. In this implementation I am using the Intel RealSense cameras.

### Hardware
I'm going to explore different solutions to achive this goal. 
* Eurotech ReliGATE 20-25 (Intel E3827 Atom Processor)

Video acquisition:
* Webcam
* Intel RealSense SR300
* Intel RealSense R200

### Tools
For the development I'm going to use:
* Yocto Project
* OpenCV
* Librealsense
